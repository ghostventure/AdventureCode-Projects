## Current operational notes

- EstateHat and CLTCH.NTWRK are separated by explicit Firebase project deploy targets.
- CLTCH Hosting deploy target is `cltch-ntwrk`.
- CLTCH deploys now hard-stop unless `npm run deploy:hosting` is run from the CLTCH repo root and the repo identity matches `cltch-ntwrk`.
- Plaid code remains present but inactive on the live CLTCH website path.
- The backend boundary now includes `/api/health` and `/api/session/bootstrap`, plus Hosting rewrites for Stripe and Plaid function routes.
